            Joe Rogan, on *The Joe Rogan Experience*, calls out Brian Johnson (Liver King) for his ‚Äúancestral lifestyle‚Äù claims, suggesting his physique is steroid-enhanced, not just raw meat and primal tenets. Johnson denies it, but leaked emails reveal he spent $11,000 monthly on steroids and human growth hormone. The internet erupts with memes, and Johnson‚Äôs $100M supplement empire takes a hit. Rogan mocks him as ‚Äúpreposterous,‚Äù refusing a podcast invite.[](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/the-liver-king-netflix-brian-johnson-arrest-joe-rogan-1236298842/)[](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/the-liver-king-joe-rogan-out-of-jail-1236300001/)[](https://people.com/liver-king-charged-over-online-threats-to-joe-rogan-11761206)

Netflix‚Äôs *Untold: The Liver King* (released May 2025, but filmed earlier) chronicles Johnson‚Äôs rise and fall, highlighting Rogan‚Äôs role in exposing him.

            On June 23, 2025, Johnson posts Instagram videos challenging Rogan to a ‚Äúman-to-man‚Äù fight, despite no jiu-jitsu training against Rogan‚Äôs black belt. Traveling to Austin, he escalates with threats like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to make you pay.‚Äù Austin Police arrest him on June 24 at the Four Seasons Hotel for terroristic threats (Class B misdemeanor). Rogan, who never met Johnson, tells police he finds the posts threatening and believes Johnson is ‚Äúsignificantly unstable‚Äù with a ‚Äúsignificant drug issue.‚Äù Johnson is released on $20,000 bail with a 200-yard restraining order, ankle monitor, and mandatory mental health evaluation.[](https://abcnews.go.com/US/liver-king-arrested-austin-after-threatening-joe-rogan/story?id=123196365)[](https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/liver-king-arrested-joe-rogan-terroristic-threats-police-1236440335/)[](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/liver-king-joe-rogan-threats-arrest-drugs-b2777637.html)

            After release, Johnson continues posting cryptic videos, avoiding Rogan‚Äôs name but referencing his Comedy Mothership club or ‚ÄúSeth Rogen.‚Äù He claims the ‚Äúvideos will never stop‚Äù and hints at a future fight, despite the restraining order and a 9 p.m. curfew. X posts reflect mixed sentiment: some call Johnson unhinged, others say Rogan provoked him by mocking his steroid use. One X user notes, ‚ÄúRogan called it out long before, but that isn‚Äôt Rogan‚Äôs fault.‚Äù Another suggests Johnson‚Äôs mental state is concerning.[](https://x.com/barstoolsports/status/1938609562182992353)[](https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/articles/joe-rogan-responds-liver-king-180334878.html)[](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/the-liver-king-joe-rogan-out-of-jail-1236300001/)
