        <h2 className="journey-title">$BEEF — Fueling Truth and Conflict</h2>
        <div className="intro-text">
          <p className="milestone-text">
            This isn’t about food. It’s about the kind of <strong>BEEF</strong> that makes people stop, think, and feel something. Conflict. Truth. Calling things out. Stirring up what matters.
          </p>
          <p className="milestone-text">
            <strong>$BEEF</strong> was born out of a personal awakening — one that came later in life, after fighting through addiction and finally seeing the world for what it is. The developer behind this token started noticing patterns: real men being mocked, truth being softened, and strong voices being silenced.
          </p>
          <p className="milestone-text">
            One of those voices? <strong>Liver King</strong>. While many laugh at him, there’s something deeper there — how he speaks, how he loves his family, how he doesn’t bend to modern nonsense. There’s a clarity behind the chaos, and <strong>$BEEF</strong> leans into that energy. It questions what we’re told. It digs into cultural contradictions. It’s not about sides — it’s about being real.
          </p>
          <p className="milestone-text">
            <strong>$BEEF</strong> is about fueling that energy — sometimes funny, sometimes serious, but always unapologetic. We’re not here to serve you meat. We’re here to serve you <strong>truth</strong>.
          </p>

          <h4 className="milestone-title">2022: The Steroid Scandal Ignites</h4>
          <p className="milestone-text">
            Joe Rogan, on <em>The Joe Rogan Experience</em>, calls out Brian Johnson (Liver King) for his “ancestral lifestyle” claims, suggesting his physique is steroid-enhanced. Johnson denies it, but leaked emails reveal he spent $11,000 monthly on steroids and HGH. The scandal rocks his $100M supplement empire. Rogan calls him “preposterous,” declining a podcast invite, as memes flood the internet.

          <p className="milestone-text">
            Johnson admits to steroid use in a public apology after the email leak. Rogan’s podcast episode discussing the scandal amasses 8.7M YouTube views, amplifying the feud. Netflix’s <em>Untold: The Liver King</em> (released May 2025, filmed earlier) details Johnson’s rise and fall, spotlighting Rogan’s role in exposing him. Johnson blames Rogan for his brand’s damage, escalating tensions.

          <h4 className="milestone-title">June 2025: Threats and Arrest</h4>
          <p className="milestone-text">
            On June 23, 2025, Johnson posts Instagram videos challenging Rogan to a “man-to-man” fight, despite no jiu-jitsu skills against Rogan’s black belt. He travels to Austin, posting threats like “I’m going to make you pay.” On June 24, Austin Police arrest him at the Four Seasons for terroristic threats (Class B misdemeanor). Rogan, who never met Johnson, tells police he believes Johnson is “significantly unstable” with a “significant drug issue.” Johnson is released on $20,000 bail with a restraining order, ankle monitor, and mental health evaluation.

          <p className="milestone-text">
            Johnson continues cryptic Instagram videos, avoiding Rogan’s name but referencing his Comedy Mothership club or “Seth Rogen.” He vows the “videos will never stop,” despite a 9 p.m. curfew. X posts show divided sentiment: some call Johnson unhinged, noting his erratic behavior; others argue Rogan provoked him by mocking his steroid use. One X user comments, “Liver King’s mental state is worrying—those videos feel desperate.” Another says, “Rogan just spoke truth, but this feud’s gone too far.”
