        <p className="milestone-text">
          Joe Rogan, on <em>The Joe Rogan Experience</em>, calls out Brian Johnson (Liver King) for his “ancestral lifestyle” claims, suggesting his physique is steroid-enhanced. Johnson denies it, but leaked emails reveal he spent $11,000 monthly on steroids and HGH. The scandal rocks his $100M supplement empire. Rogan calls him “preposterous,” declining a podcast invite, as memes flood the internet.

        <p className="milestone-text">
          On June 23, 2025, Johnson posts Instagram videos challenging Rogan to a “man-to-man” fight, despite no jiu-jitsu skills against Rogan’s black belt. He travels to Austin, posting threats like “I’m going to make you pay.” On June 24, Austin Police arrest him at the Four Seasons for terroristic threats (Class B misdemeanor). Rogan, who never met Johnson, tells police he believes Johnson is “significantly unstable” with a “significant drug issue.” Johnson is released on $20,000 bail with a restraining order, ankle monitor, and mental health evaluation.

        <h4 className="milestone-title">Post-Arrest: X Reactions</h4>
        <p className="milestone-text">
          Johnson continues cryptic Instagram videos, avoiding Rogan’s name but referencing his Comedy Mothership club or “Seth Rogen.” He vows the “videos will never stop,” despite a 9 p.m. curfew. X posts show divided sentiment: some call Johnson unhinged, noting his erratic behavior; others argue Rogan provoked him by mocking his steroid use. One X user comments, “Liver King’s mental state is worrying—those videos feel desperate.” Another says, “Rogan just spoke truth, but this feud’s gone too far.”
